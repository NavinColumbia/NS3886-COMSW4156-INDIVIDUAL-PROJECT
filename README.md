    Individual Assignment 1: Testing and Bug Fixing 

        0)Set-up:
                if data.txt doesn't exist in IndividualProject:
                        ensure port 8080 is unoccupied
                        cd IndividualProject
                        mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="setup"
                wait till "System Setup" shows up
                cancel above/any applications running in port 8080 (press control+c)
                now data.txt must exist in IndividualProject


        1)Code Clean Up
                a. Run checkstyle:
                        cd IndividualProject
                        mvn checkstyle:check
                        check console output for errors/warnings/violations.
                b. Generate javadoc:
                        cd IndividualProject
                        mvn javadoc:javadoc
                        open in browser IndividualProject/target/site/apidocs/index.html


        2)Test Suite Creation
                a. Tests can be found under IndividualProject/src/test/java
                b. Executing tests:
                        cancel running application from step 0.
                        Ensure port 8080 isn't occupied. 
                        cd IndividualProject
                        mvn clean validate compile test package       
                c. Test Reports : find '.txt' files under 'IndividualProject/target/surefire-reports/' to view test results
                d. Jacoco Report : find file 'index.html' under 'IndividualProject/target/site/jacoco/' and open with any browser to view jacoco results


        3)Bug Fixing
                a. The identified bugs, and the fixes made are documented under 'bugs.txt' at the root directory
                b. PMD(mentioned in assignment) was the static analyzer used. Installing and running PMD:
                        1.Install brew (Package Manager for Mac): Refer https://brew.sh/
                        or do: 
                                /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD install.sh)" . 
                        2.Install pmd:
                                brew install pmd 
                        3.Run PMD: 
                                cd IndividualProject
                                pmd check -d src/main/java -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f text -r "pmdres.txt" 
                                pmd check -d src/main/java -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml -f html -r "pmdres.html"
                        4.Find file named pmdres.html inside folder 'IndividualProject' ,open the html with any browse. or check 'pmdres.txt'
                          An empty content in either of the file mean no further suggestions.
                c. Run the application and test using Postman:
                        cd IndividualProject
                        cancel any applications running in port 8080
                        mvn spring-boot:run 
                        wait till "Start up" shows up
                        Test the application using Postman (https://www.postman.com/)
                        say, set URL to http://localhost:8080/retrieveCourse?deptCode=IEOR&courseCode=2500
                        select relevant method "GET" in this case, click Send and notice the result.
